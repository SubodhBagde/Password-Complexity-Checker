# Password-Complexity-Checker

The password complexity checker using GUI tkinter is a program that allows users to check the strength of their passwords based on various criteria. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the tkinter library in Python.

The GUI typically includes the following components:

Password Entry Field: A field where users can enter their passwords. The password is masked for security purposes.

Show Password Checkbox: A checkbox that allows users to toggle between showing and hiding the password in plain text.

Clear Password Button: A button that clears the password entry field.

Check Complexity Button: A button that triggers the password complexity check. The program analyzes the password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Password Strength Meter: A graphical representation (e.g., progress bar) that indicates the strength of the password based on the complexity criteria. The meter may display different colors or values to indicate the strength level (e.g., weak, moderate, strong, very strong).

Generate Password Button: A button that generates a random strong password, which can be used as a suggestion for creating a new password.

Copy Password Button: A button that copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.
